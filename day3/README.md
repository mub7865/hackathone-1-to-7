# Day 3 - API Integration and Data Migration

## **Objective**
The focus for Day 3 is integrating APIs and migrating data into Sanity CMS to build a functional marketplace backend. Students will learn how to utilize APIs for reference, migrate data into Sanity CMS, and ensure compatibility with their templates. This approach replicates real-world practices and prepares students to handle diverse client requirements, including integrating headless APIs or migrating existing data from popular eCommerce platforms.

---

## **Key Learning Outcomes**
1. Understand how to integrate APIs into your Next.js project.
2. Learn to migrate data from APIs into Sanity CMS.
3. Explore how to use existing data from eCommerce platforms like Shopify, Magento, WooCommerce, WordPress, Salesforce, Custom Backend, Sanity, Mock APIs, or others.
4. Develop skills to handle and validate schemas, ensuring alignment with data sources.

## **API Overview**

### **Provided APIs**
Below are API references for templates 0 to 9. These APIs are read-only and meant for guidance in schema validation and data migration. Students have the freedom to:
- Use these APIs to populate their Sanity CMS.
- Import data manually.
- Use other APIs or existing data sources to customize their marketplace.

## **Documentation Updates**

### **API Integration Steps**
1. **Set up Sanity CMS**:
   - Configure your Sanity project to match the structure required by your marketplace.
   - Ensure you have defined schemas for all key data (products, categories, users, etc.).
   
2. **Integrate the API**:
   - Use Next.js API routes or external libraries (like Axios or Fetch) to fetch data from the provided APIs.
   - Example:
     ```javascript
     import axios from 'axios';

     const fetchProducts = async () => {
       try {
         const response = await axios.get('API_URL/products');
         return response.data;
       } catch (error) {
         console.error('Error fetching products:', error);
       }
     };
     ```
   
3. **Migrate Data to Sanity**:
   - Write scripts to transform API data into the format required by Sanity schemas.
   - Use Sanityâ€™s `client.createOrReplace()` method to push data into the CMS.

4. **Validate Data**:
   - Ensure that all fields in the Sanity CMS match the corresponding data points in the API.
   - Test the integration by checking if data appears correctly in your Sanity CMS and is reflected in the frontend.

---

## **Challenges**
- **Data Alignment**: Ensure that the structure of the data in your API matches the schema definitions in Sanity.
- **API Rate Limits**: Handle API rate limits by adding retries or waiting mechanisms.
- **Sanity CMS Schema Handling**: Be sure to define clear and concise schemas that can handle dynamic data and future API changes.

---

## **Final Deliverables**
1. **Integrated APIs**: Functional API integration into the Next.js project.
2. **Populated Sanity CMS**: All required data imported into Sanity CMS.
3. **Working Marketplace Backend**: Data is accessible from the CMS and properly displayed on the frontend.

---

## **Conclusion**
Day 3 focused on the crucial task of connecting external data sources with Sanity CMS. By integrating APIs and migrating data, the backend functionality of the marketplace was enhanced, making it more dynamic and ready for the final stage of development.
